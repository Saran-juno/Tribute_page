  <strong>Carl Friedrich Benz (German: [bɛnts] (listen); 25 November 1844 – 4 April 1929), also Karl Friedrich Benz </strong>with the same pronunciation, was a German engine designer and automotive engineer. <ul>
    <li>His Benz Patent Motorcar from 1885 is considered the first practical modern automobile and first car put into series production.He received a patent for the motorcar in 1886.</li>

<li>His company Benz & Cie., based in Mannheim, was the world's first automobile plant and largest of its day.In 1926, it merged with Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft to form Daimler-Benz, which produces the Mercedes-Benz among other brands.</li>

<p><h3>Benz's first factory and early inventions</p></h3>
<li>In 1871, at the age of twenty-seven, Benz joined August Ritter in launching the Iron Foundry and Mechanical Workshop in Mannheim, later renamed Factory for Machines for Sheet-metal Working</li>

<li>In 1878 he began to work on new patents. First, he concentrated on creating a reliable petrol two-stroke engine. Benz finished his two-stroke engine on 31 December 1879, and was granted a patent for it on 28 June 1880.</li>

<li>While designing what would become the production standard for his two-stroke engine, Benz patented the speed regulation system, the ignition using sparks with battery, the spark plug, the carburetor, the clutch, the gear shift, and the water radiator.</li></ul>

<p><h3>Benz's long-distance drive</h3></p>

<ul><li>The world's first long distance automobile trip was undertaken by Bertha Benz using a Model 3.On the morning of 5 August 1888 Bertha – supposedly without the knowledge of her husband – took the vehicle on a 104 km (65 mi) trip from Mannheim to Pforzheim to visit her mother, taking her sons Eugen and Richard with her.</li>
<li>In 2008, the Bertha Benz Memorial Route was officially approved as a route of the industrial heritage of mankind, because it follows Bertha Benz's tracks of the world's first long-distance journey by automobile in 1888. The public can now follow the 194 km (121 mi) of signposted route from Mannheim via Heidelberg to Pforzheim (Black Forest) and back. </li></ul>
<p><h3>The first Mercendes Benz in 1926</h3></p>
<ul><li>On 28 June 1926, Benz & Cie. and DMG finally merged as the Daimler-Benz company, baptizing all of its automobiles, Mercedes-Benz, honoring the most important model of the DMG automobiles, the 1902 Mercedes 35 hp, along with the Benz name.</li>
<li> <cite>A new logo was created in 1926, consisting of a three pointed star (representing Daimler's motto: "engines for land, air, and water") surrounded by traditional laurels from the Benz logo, and the brand of all of its automobiles was labeled Mercedes-Benz. Model names would follow the brand name in the same convention as today.</cite></li></ul>

  <strong>On 4 April 1929, Benz died at his home in Ladenburg at the age of 84 from a bronchial inflammation.</strong> Until her death on 5 May 1944, Bertha Benz continued to reside in their last home. Members of the family resided in the home for thirty more years. The Benz home now has been designated as historic and is used as a scientific meeting facility for a nonprofit foundation, the Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz Foundation.
